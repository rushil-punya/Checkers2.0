Checkers 2.0 is essentially Checkers with a slight twist

1. One's own pieces can jump over one another
2. After eliminating an enemy piece, you gain another turn during which you can move any of your pieces

These files are directly exported from Eclipse so if you're using that you can just dump these files into an Eclipse project.
Otherwise, the source files are found in the "src" folder and you can use those to import into whatever IDE you're using.
